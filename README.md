Input = 12927_9864490
Output = OD12927_9864490
Input is from OrderDog, a list of EDI orders. User would scan the doc for PartNu(J column) and the Quantity(K column) and manually enter into the ERP system.
We can save time by formatting the csv so the ERP system can enter the orders, reducing user error. 
Output is the format that our ERP system will take. 

Goal is to learn how to use pandas lib in this project.
